Points to note before you rebuild the application:

1. This example has been tested with Oracle & Pointbase database. If you need to change the database, make relevant entries in applicationContext.xml, and also make sure that you have the required libraries in classpath.

2. The libraries required to rubuild this application is not included. You will find the required information at two subdirectories viz. JotmLib & lib

3. You also need ant (Java build tool) to rebuild the application. After copying all the required jar files, type 'ant' to build the application.
